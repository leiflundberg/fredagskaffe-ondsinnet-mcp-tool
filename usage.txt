Base64 works by encoding every 3 bytes of binary data into 4 characters. Each character represents 6 bits of information. So:

- Original data: 3 bytes
- Encoded data: 4 Base64 characters

Base64 characters are stored as text, which takes more space than raw binary. This leads to:

- ~33% increase in size






Despite the size increase, Base64 is widely used because:

- It avoids corruption in text-only systems.
- It’s easy to embed in HTML, XML, or JSON.
- It simplifies transport across platforms that don’t support binary.
